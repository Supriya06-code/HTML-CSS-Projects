    <section class="bulletpoints">
        <p><strong>Savitribai Phule</strong> was a pioneering Indian social reformer and educationist who played a crucial role in advancing women's rights and education in the 19th century. Born in 1831 in Maharashtra, she became one of India's first female teachers and, along with her husband Jyotirao Phule, worked tirelessly to promote education for girls and the marginalized communities. In 1848, she co-founded the first school for girls in Pune, challenging deeply entrenched societal norms that denied education to women. Savitribai also fought against caste discrimination and advocated for the empowerment of widows and untouchables, opening a shelter for oppressed women. Her work laid the foundation for social reform in India, particularly in the areas of gender equality and education, making her a key figure in the Indian feminist and anti-caste movements. Her legacy continues to inspire generations in the fight for equality and social justice.</p>
